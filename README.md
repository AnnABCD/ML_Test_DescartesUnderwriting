# Machine Learning for auto insurance

The aim of the project is to write a code in python that should be able to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017/data of target *TARGET_FLAG*. This code also returns the value of the performance of the algorithms tested using appropriate metrics and generates a csv file with the predictions. 

The code can be found in *ML_autoinsurance.py*. The predictions for *TARGET_FLAG* of the *test_auto* datset is in *test_predictions.csv*. In order that my code is not too heavy, I put my technical choices justifications and possible improvements in a report file *report.md*.

### Packages
To be run the code need the following packages to be installed : numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn, xgboost.
